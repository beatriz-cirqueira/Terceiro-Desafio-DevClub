## :house: About the project

<p>This was a very difficult project in my learning of FrontEnd Development, because I made it thinking only in the desktop experience at first. Then, having learned about the importance of making reponsives projects, I had the mission of applying the knowledge in this project. It made very clear to me about the importance of think first in the mobile experience. I made it with my mentor Rodolfo Mori in DevClub's course Full Stack Pro.</p>
